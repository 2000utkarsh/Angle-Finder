## Angle Finder
With the inclusion of Machine Learning with opencv, we have been able to unlock the potentials of our algorithms to derive useful informations from images, videos and graphic images. One of the various attributes that can be explored is size of the object. We can achieve this if we know the specifications of the lens of the camera. We can with the help of a little maths, predict what the size of a 2D object shall be. 

It uses the distance of the image to the camera lens which is used to predict the dimensions of the image. 

### DATASET
I was provided with image and I used it to predict the dimensions of th object in the provided image.and we were also given a video from which we can extract out the frames and predict the dimensions of the given object in image.

### APPROACH
We have employed opencv module for the scanning of the images and to capture the dimensions of the image provided. The lens of the camera(int this case, it is the webcam) , provided us with the distance of the image from the lens of the camera. And then , we would just measure the diemsnions of the object in image as it is in image, and finally using both of them, we would be able to predict the dimensions of the object.

### FUTURE SCOPE
With this use of OpenCV, one can easily detect the potential size of an object, which has huge applications in the field of medical sciences where our model can predict whether the size of an organ or an outspring is growing. The same can be used for the detection of tumor or moles inside the skin or body of the patient. The uses can be further extended to meteorological uses like predicitng the shape of an upcoming meteor or the debris falling from space . Further, it can be used to detect the size of the vehicles or to know the specs of a device r to identify certain person in a video.
The model can have varied uses and the scope of the model is vast and ever-increasing
